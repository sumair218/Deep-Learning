Digit Classification with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the SVHN Dataset
This project focuses on building and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras to classify digits from the Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset. The main objectives include understanding the fundamentals of CNNs, preprocessing real-world image data, and optimizing model performance. The project involves designing a CNN architecture, training the model on the SVHN dataset, and evaluating its performance in digit classification. By the end, the model achieves robust results in recognizing digits from street-level images.
